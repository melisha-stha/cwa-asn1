# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Court Room Challenge is an interactive debugging simulation game that tests players' ability to fix code issues within time constraints while managing distractions. The game features three difficulty levels with dynamic timing, progressive messaging, and penalty systems to create an engaging coding experience that simulates real-world development pressures.

## Glossary

- **Game_System**: The main court room challenge game application
- **Player**: The user playing the debugging game
- **Debugging_Issue**: A specific code problem that must be fixed (e.g., input validation, alt tags, secure database, user login)
- **Fix_Message**: Initial notification about a debugging issue that appears at scheduled times
- **Urgent_Fix_Message**: Escalated notification when a debugging issue remains unfixed after the initial message
- **Penalty_Page**: Full-screen display shown when urgent fixes are ignored, ending the game
- **Minor_Distraction**: Random popup messages from family, boss, or Agile that don't block gameplay
- **Game_Duration**: Total time allocated for the selected difficulty level (60s, 300s, or 600s)
- **Dynamic_Timer**: Timer system that scales message timing proportionally to game duration
- **Code_Editor**: Interface where players can edit provided buggy code to fix issues

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to select a difficulty level, so that I can choose an appropriate challenge level for my coding skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Game_System SHALL provide three difficulty options: Easy (1 minute), Medium (5 minutes), and Difficult (10 minutes)
2. WHEN Easy mode is selected, THE Game_System SHALL create 1 debugging issue (input validation)
3. WHEN Medium mode is selected, THE Game_System SHALL create 4 debugging issues (alt tags, input validation, secure database, user login)
4. WHEN Difficult mode is selected, THE Game_System SHALL create 6 debugging issues (2 image-related, 2 input-related, 1 secure database, 1 user login)
5. THE Game_System SHALL display appropriate buggy code template based on selected difficulty

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see one popup at a time, so that I can focus on the current message without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Game_System SHALL display only one popup message at any given time
2. WHEN a Fix_Message or Urgent_Fix_Message is active, THE Game_System SHALL queue Minor_Distraction popups for later display
3. WHEN no critical popup is active, THE Game_System SHALL display queued Minor_Distraction popups in order
4. THE Game_System SHALL process popup queue automatically when current popup is dismissed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want dynamic timing based on my selected difficulty, so that all message timings scale appropriately to the game length.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Game_System SHALL calculate all message timings proportionally to the selected Game_Duration
2. WHEN Easy mode is active, THE Game_System SHALL schedule Fix_Message at 25% of Game_Duration (15 seconds)
3. WHEN Easy mode is active, THE Game_System SHALL schedule Urgent_Fix_Message at 50% of Game_Duration (30 seconds) if issue remains unfixed
4. WHEN Easy mode is active, THE Game_System SHALL schedule Penalty_Page at 75% of Game_Duration (45 seconds) if urgent fix ignored
5. WHEN Medium or Difficult mode is active, THE Game_System SHALL schedule Fix_Messages at 10-15% intervals with dynamic spacing throughout Game_Duration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to edit code to fix debugging issues, so that I can resolve problems and progress in the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Game_System SHALL provide a Code_Editor interface with buggy code appropriate to the selected difficulty
2. WHEN a Player modifies code correctly to fix a Debugging_Issue, THE Game_System SHALL detect the fix automatically
3. WHEN a Debugging_Issue is resolved after Fix_Message but before Urgent_Fix_Message, THE Game_System SHALL cancel the scheduled Urgent_Fix_Message
4. WHEN a Debugging_Issue is resolved after Urgent_Fix_Message but before Penalty_Page, THE Game_System SHALL cancel the scheduled Penalty_Page
5. THE Game_System SHALL track resolution status of all Debugging_Issues in real-time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to end the trial when I'm done, so that I can complete the game and see my results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Player clicks "End Trial" and all Debugging_Issues are resolved, THE Game_System SHALL display a congratulatory message
2. WHEN a Player clicks "End Trial" and Debugging_Issues remain unresolved, THE Game_System SHALL display "Fix the remaining bugs before ending the trial"
3. WHEN all Debugging_Issues are resolved and timer expires, THE Game_System SHALL display congratulatory message automatically
4. THE Game_System SHALL generate final HTML code output when game completes successfully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive escalating warnings for unfixed issues, so that I understand the urgency and consequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Fix_Message timeout expires without resolution, THE Game_System SHALL display an Urgent_Fix_Message for the same issue
2. WHEN an Urgent_Fix_Message timeout expires without resolution, THE Game_System SHALL display a Penalty_Page and end the game
3. WHEN Easy mode penalty triggers, THE Game_System SHALL display "You are fined for breaking the Laws of Tort"
4. WHEN Medium mode penalty triggers for accessibility issues, THE Game_System SHALL display "You are fined for breaking the Disability Act"
5. WHEN Difficult mode penalty triggers for security issues, THE Game_System SHALL display "You have been declared bankrupt and no one can use your app"

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive random distractions during gameplay, so that the game simulates real-world coding interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Game_System SHALL generate Minor_Distraction popups randomly throughout the Game_Duration
2. WHEN Easy mode is active, THE Game_System SHALL display 1-2 Minor_Distraction popups at safe intervals
3. WHEN Medium mode is active, THE Game_System SHALL display random Minor_Distraction popups at moderate frequency
4. WHEN Difficult mode is active, THE Game_System SHALL display frequent Minor_Distraction popups (every 7+ seconds minimum)
5. THE Game_System SHALL source Minor_Distraction content from family, boss, or Agile message categories
6. THE Game_System SHALL avoid scheduling Minor_Distraction popups within 5 seconds of critical Fix_Messages or Urgent_Fix_Messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want different types of debugging issues based on difficulty, so that the complexity matches my selected challenge level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Easy mode is active, THE Game_System SHALL present input validation debugging issues requiring email format checks
2. WHEN Medium mode is active, THE Game_System SHALL present alt tag accessibility, input validation, secure database, and user login debugging issues
