# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Validate and improve timing system logic





  - Review current timing calculations against requirements for proportional scaling
  - Ensure Easy mode uses exactly 25%, 50%, 75% timing intervals
  - Verify Medium and Difficult modes use proper 10-15% initial intervals with dynamic spacing
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 2. Enhance popup queue management system





  - Verify only one popup displays at a time across all message types
  - Ensure critical messages take priority over minor distractions
  - Implement proper queue processing when popups are dismissed
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_
-

- [x] 3. Improve code validation logic for debugging issues




  - Enhance alt tag detection to handle edge cases and multiple image scenarios
  - Strengthen input validation detection for flexible coding approaches
  - Verify secure database and authentication fix detection accuracy
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 8.4, 8.5_

- [x] 4. Optimize distraction message timing and frequency





  - Implement safe interval calculation to avoid conflicts with critical messages
  - Adjust distraction frequency based on difficulty level (more frequent in Difficult mode)
  - Ensure minimum 5-second buffer around Fix_Messages and Urgent_Fix_Messages
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.6_

- [x] 5. Validate challenge cancellation logic





  - Ensure Urgent_Fix_Messages are cancelled when issues are fixed after Fix_Message
  - Verify Penalty_Pages are cancelled when issues are fixed after Urgent_Fix_Message
  - Test real-time fix detection and challenge state updates
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 6.1, 6.2_

- [x] 6. Enhance end trial validation and win conditions




  - Strengthen "Fix remaining bugs" message logic for incomplete challenges
  - Improve congratulatory message display for successful completion
  - Verify automatic win detection when timer expires with all issues fixed
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
-

- [ ] 7. Improve message history and notification system








  - Verify message history maintains complete record with proper timestamps
  - Ensure unread counter accuracy and reset functionality
  - Enhance critical message distinction in history display
  - _Requirements: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5_

- [ ]* 8. Add comprehensive testing for game logic
  - Write unit tests for timing calculation functions
  - Create integration tests for complete game flow scenarios
  - Add validation tests for code fix detection patterns
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ]* 9. Performance optimization and error handling
  - Optimize timer interval management and cleanup
  - Add error boundaries for graceful failure handling
  - Implement debounced code validation for large inputs
  - _Requirements: Performance and reliability improvements_
